        species has experienced rapid declines across most of its European range.
        Population trends outside Europe are unknown. Extrapolated over three generation
        lengths and allowing for uncertainty, the population is thought to be declining
        at a rate sufficient to be listed as Vulnerable. Should population trends
        become less uncertain both within and outside its European range it may merit
        uplisting or downlisting.","geographicrange":"The Atlantic Puffin can be found
        throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, from north-west Greenland (<strong>to
        </strong><strong>Denmark</strong>) to the coastline of Newfoundland (<strong>Canada</strong>)
        and Maine (<strong>USA</strong>) in the west, and from north-west <strong>Russia&#160;</strong>down
        to the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain</strong> (in winter) in the east (del
        Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The population in <strong>Iceland</strong>
        and <strong>Norway</strong>, which together account for 80% of the European
        population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International
        2015).&#160;In much of Iceland breeding has generally failed every year since
        2003, but in the north, at least, it has been borderline sustainable (G. A.
        Gudmundsson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, E. Hansen <em>in litt. </em>2016,
        A. Petersen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The largest Norwegian colony, Røst, has
        experienced sharp declines&#160;from almost 1.5 million breeding pairs in
        1979 to only 289,000 pairs in 2015, and has produced virtually no chicks in
        the last 9 years&#160;(T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, Anker-Nilssen
        <em>et al. </em>2016). Most other Norwegian colonies are much smaller, including
        that at Runde, which has also declined; however most colonies remain unmonitored
        (A. O. Folkestad&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>.
        2015, 2016). Numbers on the southern coast of the Barents Sea have increased
        such that declines in the total population in Norway are estimated at approximately
        33% since the early 1980s (Fauchald <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Populations
        in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Greenland are also reported to be decreasing
        (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>The population size was estimated to be
        increasing in the U.K. during 1969-2000, and populations in the North Sea
        are probably currently stable or increasing after a decline in the 2000s due
        to two very low overwinter survivals of adults (Harris and Wanless 2011,&#160;<a>Harris
        <em>et al.</em> 2013</a>).&#160;A reduction in the recruitment of juveniles
        into the breeding population is thought to be the most likely factor involved
        in a sharp decrease in the number of puffins at the Fair Isle (U.K.) breeding
        colony; from approximately 20,200 individuals in 1986 to 10,700 individuals
        in 2012 (Miles&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Adult survival probability remained
        similar across the 27 years of the study, whilst breeding success, the number
        of feeding visits by adults to chicks and the size of available prey fish
        all decreased. Trends from North America are uncertain, with the population
        at Great Island, Witless Bay showing increases between 1979 and 1994, but
        it has potentially stabilised or is in decline now (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015).
        A restoration project off the coast of Maine has also had some success (D.
        Wege <em>in litt. </em>2002, see&#160;http://projectpuffin.audubon.org/).<p></p>","population":"The
        European population is estimated to be 4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, which equates
        to 9,550,000-11,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).
        The global population size is estimated at&#160;12–14 million mature individuals
        (Harris and Wanless 2011; Berglund and Hentati-Sundberg 2014).","populationtrend":"decreasing","habitat":"The
        species is exclusively marine, found on rocky coasts and offshore islands
        (Nettleship <em>et al</em>. 2014). It nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea
        cliffs and rocky slopes. During the winter it is wide-ranging, found in offshore
        and pelagic habitats.<br/><br/>The species is a pursuit-diver, catching most
        of its prey within 30 m of the water surface but&#160;capable of diving to
        60 m (Piatt and Nettleship 1985, Burger and Simpson 1986)<sup></sup>. They
        prey on ''forage'' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring
        <em>Clupea harengus</em>, juvenile and adult capelin <em>Mallotus</em> <em>villosus</em>,
        and sandeel <em>Ammodytes</em> spp. (Barrett <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids; planktonic
        crustaceans; and polychaete worms (Harris and Hislop 1978, Barrett <em>et
        al. </em>1987, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996, Harris <em>et al.
        </em>2015)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the southern and eastern parts
        of its range, sandeels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks
        (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Martin 1989,
        Harris and Riddiford 1989).&#160;However, there are exceptions, such as at
        Skomer Island in 1969 when sprat made up the majority of the diet fed to chicks
        (Corkhill 1973), and in the Lofoten islands, where first-year herring are
        often the commonest food of chicks (Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006).<br/><br/>When
        feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may
        range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984,&#160;Anker-Nilssen and
        Lorentsen 1990,&#160;Rodway and Montevecchi 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        A boat transect run on one day in 1970 found that 85% of all birds seen were
        concentrated within just 3 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>,
        but other studies have found peaks in the density of foraging birds at up
        to 40 km distance from the colony (Webb <em>et al.</em> 1985, Stone <em>et
        al.</em> 1992, Stone <em>et al. </em>1993, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        Similarly, surveys and GPS tracking at the Isle of May, Scotland, suggest
        that birds forage close to the breeding colony, but also at other sites up
        to 40 km away (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990, BirdLife International 2000,
        Harris <em>et al. </em>2012)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Various studies
        (Pearson 1968, Corkhill 1973, Bradstreet and Brown 1985, BirdLife International
        2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, based on different breeding colonies, have
        estimated the theoretical maximum foraging radius at anywhere from 32 km (Corkhill
        1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong> to 200 km (Bradstreet and Brown 1985). <p></p>","threats":"<p>This
        species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased
        sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring,
        Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant<em> et al.</em> 2003,
        Sandvik<em> et al. </em>2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be
        due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris
        and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2016), as changing temperatures
        can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin
        breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods
        and lower fledging success (Durant <em>et al. </em>2006). Sandvik <em>et al.</em>
        (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including
        the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food
        stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population
        collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures
        (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West
        Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin
        populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson
        <em>in litt. </em>2016).</p>  <p>Extreme weather and storms can cause mass
        mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter
        storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted
        increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo <em>et al. </em>2014).
        In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death
        of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm <em>et al.</em>
        2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell
        2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000
        birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea
        (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey
        abundance) (Anker-Nilssen<em> et al.</em> 2013). A large wreck occurred in
        March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with
        periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and
        English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely
        due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell
        to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms
        that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples
        have been recorded throughout the species’ range.</p>  <p>The threat of climate
        change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey
        species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability
        and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries
        have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since
        the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as Røst,
        Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered
        the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker <em>et al. </em>2000,
        Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miles <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition
        to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct
        mortality. The Atlantic Puffin’s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species
        susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch
        has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker <em>et al.</em>
        2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a “trivial effect” on Puffin populations
        (Harris and Wanless 2011).</p>  <p>At the breeding colonies, the species is
        vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em> is
        known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms
        in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following
        decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick
        survival in parts of the range, including Hornøya, Norway (Barrett 2015).
        Rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to
        drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless
        2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock
        2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell
        <em>et al.</em> 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population
        recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006).</p>  <p>Hunting of
        puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and
        Iceland (Thorup <em>et al. </em>2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting
        grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting
        season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality,
        in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were
        recorded to be taken annually in the Nólsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in
        Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed
        recruitment rate on Iceland, while the Nólsoy population is considered stable
        only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly
        vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with
        other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species.
        Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship <em>et al. </em>2014), and
        at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently
        visited area compared to the control site (Rodway<em> et al. </em>1996).</p>  <p>The
        species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution.
        Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the
        wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers
        at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978)
        badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins
        which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number
        of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered
        or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins
        are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies
        and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to
        have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands)
        was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds
        were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest
        impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and
        ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin’s food
        resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded
        in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those
        shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles
        (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants
        were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is
        regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk
        by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already
        compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting.
        The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which
        may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and
        only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011).  </p><p>Increasing
        numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of
        collision is considered very low (Bradbury <em>et al.</em> 2014). However,
        a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with
        man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015).<br/></p>","conservationmeasures":"<strong>Conservation
